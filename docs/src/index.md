> Finding pathways of interest within OMOPCDM data has never been easier !

This package uses a functional approach to extract meaningful Pathways from databases in the [OMOP Common Data Model format](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/) format whereby you could build rapidly lines of inquiry into the database. Furthermore, this package is a companion to those tools found in the HADES ecosystem. To get started, visit the [Tutorials](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/OMOPCDMPathways.jl/blob/main/docs/src/tutorials.md) section as well as visit the [API](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/OMOPCDMPathways.jl/blob/main/docs/src/api.md) section to see all the functions available. If you want to contribute, please check out our [Contributing](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/OMOPCDMPathways.jl/blob/main/docs/src/contributing.md) guide!


## Why Pathways ? ðŸ¤”
Patient pathways outline a patientâ€™s care process, from initial contact to subsequent future patient and health provider interactions. Patient pathways play an important role in Observational Health Studies as they give insight into how patients are treated for specific conditions and the way their care evolves over time. By analyzing these pathways, researchers can identify treatment patterns, assess adherence to treatment, identify gaps in care, optimize resource allocation, and potentially improve patient outcomes and the quality of healthcare
delivery.
